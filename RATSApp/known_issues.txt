# UI bugs:
- confirm w/o selection in read old stats crashes < needs a back button

## statistic fails:

- totals of team touches blocks etc on that screen

some text oddities

# for some reason there was a nonetype object saved in the list of points
# have check to protect against this but that's a bandaid


## plans
resuming saved game -> confirm input screen should have button -> popup -> select game to load- > continue

###if you read old stats on a game and then continue to take new stats - it continues on from the previous game

DISPLAY STATS AT POINT END
- smo goals: basic stats for broadcast


- same line / set lines

FIX GRAPHICS
- whole UI needs a restrcture - can lean more on the kv file?
- can definitely have superclasses of screens to bring consistency
- can build out screens to be sublcasses of a screeen with whatever shit i want to go scross all of them

Andy
- differentiate between blocks and interceptions

Super long term
- have one device viewing stats and one taking stats simultaneously

AFDA Scraping - csv team lists


# BUSINESS
