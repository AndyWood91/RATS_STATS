# Filming Instructions

# Data
There is a 32gb microSD card (SouthDakota) in the camera.
There is a backup 16gb microSD card (SanDiego) in a microSD adapter in the front pouch of the camera bag.
If both of these fill up we're done recording!

# Camera Setup
Elevation is key, but if not available that's ok
Clear line of sight next priority, typically this means setting up out the back of an endzone
If possible, start a stopwatch at the start of the game (hooter) and read out/show  the time at the start+end of each point
Pause filming between points - otherwise there's heaps of useless footage

# Film Objectives
Each point, film the Brunch line, if there's spare time film the other line
Get some Brunch idiot to call the names for the audio
We need to see the disc all the time.
The more cutters you can have in shot the better, but don't lose the disc.
Prioritise being able to see the field over closeup highlights.

# Thanks so much!
You're helping out RATStats and Brunch a heap :)
Feel free to ask Rob or Andy if you have any questions
