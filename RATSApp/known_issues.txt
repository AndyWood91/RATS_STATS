TO BE FIXED IN CODE:
TeamSelectScreen - FileChoosers + KivyMD do not match
> FileChoosers may cut off filenames on small screens
!! PlayerSelectScreen is very inconsistent and sometimes sucks
# NoneType objects in game.points - caused by closing early? - protected against in reading games

ANALYSIS BUGS #*#*# Priority #*#*#
 - How many points does the fake player play - is that total points
 - looks like a bug in the total number of points
 ------ ***8---- POINTS ARE ACTUALLY SEQUENCES AT THE MOMENT

## plans
resuming saved game -> confirm input screen should have button -> popup -> select game to load- > continue

DISPLAY STATS AT POINT END

Super long term
- have one device viewing stats and one taking stats simultaneously
- location taking

# BUSINESS
- look at restructuring output into a relational database. Not sure about SQL, want open source.

# PLACEHOLDERS
- divisions, numbers, possessions

TODO LIST:

TO MAKE TAKING STATS EASIER:
- same line / set lines
- player numbers
- resuming saved game

STUFF TO BUILD:
- the magic number
- Expected Goals per Point (offence and defence)
- Some kind of catchall player valuation metric
- combination regressions

- email Mike Palmer about livestream integration
- take stats on Chilly game (fix player selection screen; Rob; make drops work)
- make rewind function (not necessary until the next live taking)

SOCIAL MEDIA
- long term: build own website with good integration to our stuff
- set up Google Account
- need to decide on a name: The People's Statisticians, East Coast Bias, The Resident Statisticians;
    The Rodent Statisticians
- analysis posted in Google Sheets, any commentary in Google Docs
- short term - set up Twitter/FB. Looking to get amongst Women's College Ulti, be explicit about our feminist utopia

REDO WORKFLOW
- have git - need to work on csv storage + sql database
