27/3/17

# What this is:
A functional ultimate stat-taking program, that can pipe out data as csv files.

# What it could be:
National Championships
Coaching staff spots 
Commentary Superstars
Numbers-backed shit talk

# What you need to run the program:
Python 2.7 (migration to 3.5 in the pipeline)
Kivy 1.9.1 - https://kivy.org/
Google Drive API - https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation
httplib2 - https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2

# What you need to build the program into an Android APK:
Buildozer # rob to expand on this

# What you need to take stats:
Either running program or app
Teamlists (preferably for the whole tournament)

UI Restructure incoming - should be no functional change
Game object hierarchy - going to require careful fixes to match up to stat taking screen flow
