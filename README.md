Coaching staff spots \n
Commentary Superstars\n
Numbers-backed shit talk\n

# What you need to run the program:
Python 2.7 (migration to 3.5 in the pipeline)\n
Kivy 1.9.1 - https://kivy.org/ \n
Google Drive API - https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation \n
httplib2 - https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2 \n

# What you need to build the program into an Android APK:
Buildozer # rob to expand on this\n

# What you need to take stats:

Teamlists (preferably for the whole tournament)\n
